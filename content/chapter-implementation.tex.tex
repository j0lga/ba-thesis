This section provides a brief overview of experimental setup as well as used libraries
and frameworks and gives an explanation for the choices.


Despite \acp{gnn} being such a big deal and widely used in various domains, there
is a lack of standartisation in machine learning on graphs. Tensorflow has no build-in structure for
graph representation and expects the input to be tensors or dictionaries.


A few attempts were made towards dealing with graph-structured data in a standardized way
