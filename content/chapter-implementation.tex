% Representation of Graphs 

\label{sec:implement:sec1}
This section provides a brief overview of experimental setup as well as used libraries
and frameworks and gives an explanation for the choices.
Despite \acp{gnn} being such a big deal and widely used in various domains, there
is a lack of standartisation in machine learning on graphs. Tensorflow has no build-in structure for
graph representation and expects the input to be tensors or dictionaries.
A few attempts were made towards dealing with graph-structured data in a standardized way
Spektral is
Despite \acfp{gnn} being a hot topic, there still is no standardized way of dealing with
graphs in terms of representation, ....

A few efforts have been made to create standardized frameworks and libraries.
Such examples are Spektral, and NetworX
