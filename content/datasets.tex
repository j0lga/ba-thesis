% OGB dataset 
The OGB dataset is a benchmark dataset.

Benchmark datasets are compiled for developing machine
vision algorithms, and testing and comparing the performance
of different algorithms to identify the most effective solution
to a given biomedical image analysis problem.


In machine learning, benchmarking is the practice of comparing tools
to identify the best-performing technologies in the industry. However,
comparing different machine learning platforms can be a difficult task due
to the large number of factors involved in the performance of a tool.




The Open Graph Benchmark launched in 2019 is perhaps the first attempt
toward this goal trying to introduce challenging graph learning tasks on
interesting real-world graph-structured datasets. One of the hurdles is that
tech companies producing diverse and rich graphs from their usersâ€™ activity
are reluctant to share these data due to concerns over privacy laws such as GDPR.
A notable exception is Twitter that made a dataset of 160 million tweets with
corresponding user engagement graphs available to the research community under
certain privacy-preserving restrictions as part of the RecSys Challenge. I hope
that many companies will follow suit in the future.
